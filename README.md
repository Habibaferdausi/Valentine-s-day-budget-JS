# Valentine's Day Budget


As for a budget check web application made with JavaScript, it would be a tool that helps users keep track of their expenses and stick to a budget. It could include features such as creating a budget plan, tracking spending, categorizing expenses, and total expenses balance  reports to show how well the user is sticking to their budget. 

In this project I used HTML5 , CSS framework Bootstrap and JavaScript

Using JavaScript and DOM is a web-based application that allows users to add from a virtual shopping cart. The use of Bootstrap ensures that your shopping cart is responsive, meaning it can be easily accessed on any device, whether it's a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.
